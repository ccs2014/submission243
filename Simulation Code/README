This tarball includes code for the following policies:

1. Complete Control Flow Integrity
	./cfi-ccfi

	To run the CCFI poliy, 

	cd cfi-ccfi
	make
	./sim.sh gcc 1000000 1024 4096          (./sim <benchmark> <Ninstr> <L1-pump size> <l2-pump size>)

	Running this will save the results (number of misses in L1 and L2 PUMP caches in the directory ``results'' for each 1000 instructions).
	``m-vectors'' has the rules that miss in the L2 PUMP.
	``tags'' has the information on tags created at the start and the end of the simulation.
	``cfg'' stores out the control-flow graph extracted from the instruction trace.
	``l2misses'' has the instruction numbers that missed in the L2 pump



2. Memory Safety with N colors.
	./memory_safety

	To run this policy,

	cd memory_safety
	make
	./sim.sh gcc 1000000 100 1024 4096


3. Taint tracking with libtaint
	./taint_tracking

	To run the Taint Tracking poliy, 

	cd tracking
	make
	./sim.sh gcc 1000000 1024 4096          (./sim <benchmark> <Ninstr> <L1-pump size> <l2-pump size>)


4. Composite Policy
	./composite

	To run the Composite poliy, 

	cd composite
	make
	./sim.sh gcc 1000000 100 1024 4096          (./sim <benchmark> <Ninstr> <Ncolor> <L1-pump size> <l2-pump size>)




Benchmarks: currenly this tarball only contains 1M instruction trace for the ``gcc'' benchmark (produced using gem5) along with a file with gcc's code taints.
